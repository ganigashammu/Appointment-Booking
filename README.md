Developed a Clinic Appointment Booking System using React.js and Tailwind CSS, focused on creating an intuitive frontend experience for users to schedule doctor appointments.

User Navigation and Account Creation: Users can create accounts from the home page to book appointments and explore doctor specialties and top available doctors.

Doctor Directory and Filtering: The "All Doctors" section lists doctors with a sidebar filter by specialty. Clicking on a doctor redirects users to their detailed appointment page.

Doctor Profiles and Appointment Scheduling: Profiles include experience, age, qualifications, and availability. Users can book appointments by selecting a date and time within a 7-day window.

Informational Pages: Includes About Us and Contact Us pages with details about the clinic's services. This is a frontend-only application.
